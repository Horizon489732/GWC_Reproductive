🏗 Project Structure

This project uses React & Next.js (App Router) for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.

Adding a New Page (Frontend)

If you want to add a new page to the site:

Create a new folder inside the app/ directory.

Inside that folder, add a page.js file.

Example:

app/
├── about/
│   ├── page.js  // New page file

This follows Next.js App Router conventions, where each folder represents a route.

If your page requires additional components, create a components/ directory inside your page folder.

Backend Contributions

If you're interested in working on the Node.js backend, please reach out to me or an executive board member before making changes.

This helps us coordinate efforts and avoid conflicts in backend development.

🔥 Development Best Practices

Write clean and readable code.

Use meaningful commit messages. Example: feat: add About page

Follow Next.js conventions for project structure and routing.

Test your code before submitting a PR.

Stay active in discussions! Collaboration is key. 😊
